## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. These systems improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model makes predictions based on input-output pairs.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns and structures in the data without predefined labels.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Applications

Machine learning has numerous applications including:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles

## Conclusion

Machine learning continues to evolve and transform various industries, making it one of the most important technologies of our time.
